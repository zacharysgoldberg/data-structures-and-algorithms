1.  Initialize two pointers, index_s1 and index_s2, to zero for iterating both strings.

2.  If the character pointed by index_s1 in str1 is the same as the character pointed by index_s2 in str2, increment both pointers. Otherwise, only increment index_s1.

3.  Create two new pointers (start and end) once index_s2 reaches the end of str2. With these two pointers, weâ€™ll slide the window in the opposite direction.

4.  Set the start to the value of index_s1 and end to start + 1.

5.  Decrement index_s2 if the character pointed by the start pointer in str1 is equal to the character pointed to by index_s2 in str2 and decrement the start pointer until index_s2 becomes less than zero.

6.  Calculate the length of a substring by subtracting values of the end and start variables.

7.  If this length is less than the current minimum length, update the length variable and min_subsequence string

8.  Repeat until index_s1 reaches the end of str1.
